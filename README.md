# Reverb Code Extension

These code extensions are designed so that we can code together during an on-site interview. Our guiding principal is: **we want to see you at your best** .

## Instructions
1. We'll use your machine to drive. Ensure you are ready to go by having anything installed beforehand and that the project can run as-is. If you don't have access to a computer, **let us know** and we'll arrange an alternative setup.
1. Familiarize yourself with the problem or the code.
1. That's it! We'll give you all other information during the coding session.

## Tips
- We'll be using GraphQL. We don't expect you to be an expert, but if you want to brush up, [these docs](https://graphql.org/learn/) summarize the spec and feature set nicely. We serve [GraphQL over HTTP](https://graphql.org/learn/serving-over-http/)
- GraphiQL is great to poke around our GraphQL schema. 
  - `brew cask install graphiql` or available [here](https://github.com/skevy/graphiql-app/releases/download/v0.7.2/GraphiQL-0.7.2.dmg)
- We really like using [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com), the free version is fine.
